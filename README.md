# semrushwrapper
Non-official wrapper for SEMrush's API

# Disclaimer

This module is not part of SEMrush's products. It is an independent project and is in no way supported by SEMrush.<br><br>

# WARNING!

`semrushwrapper` allows the execution of multiple requests in a single call, for instance, when passing a list of domains to `domain_rank`. <span style="color:red">**This can consume A LOT of API units!**</span>
